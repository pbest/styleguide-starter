#Basic style guide template

This is a very basic style guide template which acts as a repository for front-end design patterns.

###Requirements
---

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed:

1. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) - You can use the installer, but I personally like using [Homebrew](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
3. [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com) - `npm install -g gulp`
4. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - `gem install jekyll`

###Getting started
---

- Clone this repository into your working directory.
- Navigate to the directory and run `npm install`. This will install the required node modules for the project.

###Using the framework
---

- Run `gulp`. This will run the Gulp tasks needed for:
    -  compiling Sass, 
    -  concatenating Javascript, 
    -  serving the Jekyll site, 
    -  watch for changes to relevant folders and reload the browser accordingly.

###Acknowledgements

This template references a number of brilliant projects.
